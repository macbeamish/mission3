API 2. Convert "Claim History" to a "Risk Rating"

This API takes 1 parameters as input in JSON format that has a text field describing the claim history in the last 3 years of a driver requesting for a quote.  The output is a JSON format with the suggested rating of the driver from 1 to 5, 5 being a high risk driver and 1 being a low risk driver.  Here are the example specifications and business rules of conversion:

INPUT

{ claim_history: "My only claim was a crash into my house's garage door that left a scratch on my car. 
 There are no other crashes." }

OUTPUT

{ risk_rating: 3 }

ERROR OUTPUT

{ error: "there is an error"}

BUSINESS RULES

Risk rating is calculated by counting the number of occurrences of a list of keywords. 
 Each occurrence (regardless of whether they are repeats) will add 1 to the risk rating. 
  The keyword list is "collide", "crash", "scratch", "bump", "", and "smash".  
  For example, "My only claim was a crash into my house's garage door that left a scratch on my car.
   There are no other crashes." returns a rating of 3 (counting the underlined letters).
     If input value is not valid, return an error.
